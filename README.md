SQUASHLANDS Jukebox

In the heart of Liverpool, you will find one of the most prestigious gym centres in the state - that is Squashlands Gym and Fitness Centre. With a large range of equipment, wide range of supplements as well as low-priced memberships, patrons don’t think twice before they join the gym. As good as Squashlands Gym is, the feedback has been coming in regards to ways the gym can improve - and the major area in need for improvement is music.

Music is a prominent figure to anyone’s workout, and gym patrons at Squashlands prefer to have control over the music that’s being played throughout their workout. This kind of feedback is crucial for any business moving forward - failure to act upon this could result in loss of members, and potentially revenue. This calls for a jukebox application that allows gym patrons to select a song from the Squashlands local library and add it to a queue waiting for the song to be played. Should the Jukebox application be a success, this could open the door to an increase of memberships and guests coming into their gym.

The solution is a simple one - using Flask and VLC Media Player, with an Android application. An android application will be made for the gym patrons to use, so that they can use to search for the song of their choice and write their name. Once they add a song to the queue, the request will go back to the administration staff, who will have a server running picking up and sending back requests between the application and VLC Media Player, which will be playing across multiple TV screens in the gym. The patron’s selection and name will be used for the administration staff as part of their song analytics with a timestamp included, which can help them gather data on what songs are chosen at certain times of the day and how frequently.

Who are we? We are three third year ICT students studying at Western Sydney University at the Sydney City Campus. We have our fair share of experience when it comes to making applications. Over the past three years, we have worked extensively on the fundamentals of programming, design, servers and databases - which are key components needed to make this Jukebox application. 

We are very excited for the prospect of working with a proud family-run business like Squashlands Gym and Fitness Centre and are confident in our ability to provide a high quality Jukebox application suitable to your requirements.


The system has been worked on by more students, below are some of those projects based on this system:
